Dataset
=======
- 10 minutes samples
- 400 Hz of sampling frequency
- 16 channels (sensors)
				=> Each data has 400*60*10 = 240,000 measurements for each channel

Data Structure
==============
- I_J_K.mat -> the J-th training data segment corresponding to the K-th class (K=0 for interictal, K=1 for preictal)
	       for the I-th patient (there are three patients).
- I_J.mat   -> the J-th testing data segment for the I-th patient.

Each .mat file contains a data structure, dataStruct, with fields as follows:
- data:
	A matrix of iEEG sample values arranged row x column as time sample x electrode.
- nSamplesSegment:
	Total number of time samples (number of rows in the data field).
- iEEGsamplingRate:
	Data sampling rate, i.e. the number of data samples representing 1 second of EEG data.
- channelIndices:
	An array of the electrode indexes corresponding to the columns in the data field.
- sequence: 
	The index of the data segment within the one hour series of clips. For example, 1_12_1.mat
	has a sequence number of 6, and represents the iEEG data from 50 to 60 minutes into the preictal data.
	This field only appears in training data.

	- The temporal dynamics of brain activity can be classified into 4 states:
		- Interictal (between seizures, or baseline)
		- Preictal (prior to seizure)
		- Ictal (seizure)
		- Post-ictal (after seizure)
	- Seizure forecasting:
		- Reliably identify a Preictal state

	- Interesting frequency range: 8-30 Hz (the range where there are beta, alpha and mu waves)
		- beta waves: 13-30 Hz
		- alpha waves: 8-13 Hz
		- mu waves: 8-13 Hz



Hints of methods that can help
==============================
1. Fourier Transform
        - for each channel
                - FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
                - Complex coefficients
                - Length of these vectors
                        -> Energy of each sinusoidal that forms the signal
                - Apply frequency filters
                        -> [a,b] -> set to zero all the irrelevant frequencies
                        -> get the new signal
                - Measurements
                        DTW
                        Euclidean distance (*P.S.: This technique is not good for this problem)
                        CCF (Cross-Correlation Function)
                                -> creates one correlation matrix for each channel in relation to the others
                - Classification


2. Short-Time Fourier Transform
	- for each channel
		- divide in blocks
			- FFT in each of these blocks
				- Amplitude (10 bins of frequencies)
				- Column vector
				- Concatenate one vector after another
					-> creates a matrix (10x?) for each channel

3. Wavelets
	- for each channel
		- wavelet (haar, daubechies)
