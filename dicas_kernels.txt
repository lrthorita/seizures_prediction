Dataset
- 10 minutes samples
- 400 Hz of sampling frequency
- 16 channels (sensors)

	- Interesting frequency range: 8-30 Hz (the range where there are beta, alpha and mu waves)
		- beta waves: 13-30 Hz
		- alpha waves: 8-13 Hz
		- mu waves: 8-13 Hz


Hints of methods that can help
==============================
1. Fourier Transform
	- for each channel
		- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)
		- Complex coefficients
		- Length of these vectors
			-> Energy of each sinusoidal that forms the signal
		- Apply frequency filters
			-> [a,b] -> set to zero all the irrelevant frequencies
			-> get the new signal
		- Measurements
			DTW
			Euclidean distance (*P.S.: This technique is not good for this problem)
			CCF (Cross-Correlation Function)
				-> creates one correlation matrix for each channel in relation to the others
		- Classification


2. Short-Time Fourier Transform
	- for each channel
		- divide in blocks
			- FFT in each of these blocks
				- Amplitude (10 bins of frequencies)
				- Column vector
				- Concatenate one vector after another
					-> creates a matrix (10x?) for each channel

3. Wavelets
	- for each channel
		- wavelet (haar, daubechies)
